a. To integrate the profiler, just do the following.
    1. Include profiler.h
    2. Create an insatnce in the root function of the program (like main()). 
       e.g. Profiler profiler(10000, "profiler_report.txt");
    3. When the profiler is destructed, it will show a pie chart with default
    explorer.

    The constructor has two parameters, one is number of samples, and the other one is file name.

b. 
This profiler is a sampling profiler. It works by creating a new thread and
sample and store the main thread's EIP instruction at fixed intervals. When
the profiler is destructed, the SymFromAddr() function will be called to get
function name for each eip address and calculate number of samples associated
with them.

c. The profiler report was written to a text file. It contains information
about percentage of samples observed lying in each function. Furthermore, a
pie chart will be generated and shown at the end of the program through
default browser.

**NOTE: This script assumes "sh" is accessible in PATH! If the report_gen.sh does
not work properly, consider execute it with cygwin bash, or install newest
version of win-bash.

**NOTE: The machine should be connected to the Internet when the pie chart is
generated

**NOTE: If the html is opened with internet explorer, the content may be
blocked. In this situation, click on "Allow Blocked Content" and it will run
as normal.

**NOTE: The script expect to find profiled_report.txt for pie chart
generation.

d. Extra credit

1. Pie chart will be generated at the end of the program, or through running
"sh report_gen.sh" after profiled_report.txt is generated.

2. Profiler used for our game engine, the results are in
extra_credit_profiled_report.txt and extra_credit_piechart.html
